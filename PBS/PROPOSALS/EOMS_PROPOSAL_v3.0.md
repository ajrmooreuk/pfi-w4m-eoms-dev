# 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## The Opportunity

Endeavour Meats processes approximately **$600M AUD annually** through manual spreadsheet-based order management. The current system is cumbersome, error-prone, and cannot scale. The proposed **EOMS Phase 1** replaces the spreadsheet-based export order process with a **simple, purpose-built order entry system** — giving the trade team a faster, more reliable way to enter, manage, and export orders.

### Market Focus

| Market | Current Focus | EOMS Phase 1 |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Export** | Primary revenue driver | **Phase 1 Focus** |
| **Domestic** | Secondary market | Future phase |

*Phase 1 focuses exclusively on the Export market, replacing the existing spreadsheet-based system with structured digital order entry.*

## Phase 1 Objective

> **Prove that we can materially improve workflow efficiency in a simple and cost-effective way before layering intelligence and automation.**

Phase 1 delivers:
- A **simple, accessible order entry interface** for the trade team
- **Structured data** (products, customers, suppliers) from a central database
- **Reduced manual rework** and time savings for traders
- A **clean export format** that can later feed into the finance system

## Value Proposition at a Glance

| Metric | Current State | Phase 1 Target | Improvement |
|--------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Order Entry Time** | 45 min | 15-20 min | -55% to -65% |
| **Error Rate** | 5-8% | <3% | -50%+ |
| **Data Consistency** | Manual / variable | Structured / validated | Step change |
| **Finance Export Readiness** | None | Clean export format | Foundation built |
| **Audit Trail** | None | Full order history | Complete |

## Recommendation

**PROCEED** with EOMS Phase 1. A focused, contained investment in order entry delivers immediate time savings and error reduction for the trade team, while building the data foundation for future AI-powered validation, analytics, and finance system integration.

# 2. THE PROBLEM TO SOLVE

## 2.1 Business Rationale

All Sales/Traders and team members find the current spreadsheet system **cumbersome and a friction point** that delays easy processing and confirmation of trades.

### The Core Problem

The spreadsheet system is **operationally cumbersome** and creates reliance on manual checks and balances that:

- **Introduce errors** in order entry and data capture
- **Slow response times** to customers
- **Delay order processing** through the pipeline
- **Create uncertainty** about information accuracy
- **Risk incomplete data** when confirming orders to the sales pipeline

## 2.2 Current State Pain Points

| Pain Point | Business Impact |
|------------|-----------------|
| **45-minute order entry time** | 12,500+ hours/year on order entry alone |
| **5-8% order error rate** | Rework, credits, customer disputes |
| **7,816 product codes** | Manual lookup and validation at scale |
| **50 orders/day capacity** | Growth constrained by process, not people |
| **Spreadsheet limitations** | No structured validation, no audit trail |
| **Tribal knowledge dependency** | Key-person risk, inconsistent data entry |

## 2.3 Cost of Inaction & Risk to Business

**Scale of Risk:** A single export order can represent **$200,000 - $300,000** for a container shipment.

| Risk Category | Annual Exposure | Notes |
|---------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Error-related costs** | $850,000+ | Based on current 5-8% error rate |
| **Delayed order processing** | Revenue at risk | Customer experience impact |
| **Missed growth opportunity** | $150M+ revenue | Cannot scale without proportional headcount |
| **Key person dependency** | Business continuity | Single points of failure in knowledge |

**The spreadsheet system is the bottleneck. Phase 1 addresses the entry point.**

# 4. THE SOLUTION: EOMS PHASE 1

## 4.1 What Phase 1 Delivers

EOMS Phase 1 is a **focused order entry system** that replaces the spreadsheet process with a structured, database-backed application.

### Core Capabilities — Phase 1

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Order Entry Wizard** | Guided step-by-step order creation with structured fields |
| **Product Search** | Fast search across 7,816 product codes with market eligibility display |
| **Customer Lookup** | Buyer, consignee, and notify party selection from central database |
| **Supplier/Establishment** | Supplier and establishment number selection |
| **Shipping Details** | Container type, incoterms, port of loading/destination, shipping dates |
| **Order List & Status** | View all orders with filtering — Draft, Complete, Exported |
| **Order Export to Finance** | Clean export in CSV/JSON format for downstream processing |
| **Audit Trail** | Full history of order creation, edits, and status changes |

### What Phase 1 Does NOT Include

The following are **deliberately deferred** to future phases, allowing Phase 1 to remain focused and deliverable:

| Deferred Capability | Rationale for Deferral |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| AI Validation Agents | Prove the workflow first, add intelligence later |
| FX Contract Integration | FX booked separately; automated PnL report already covers actual rates |
| Margin Threshold Alerts | Daily PnL reporting catches margin issues; nice-to-have, not essential |
| Approval Workflows | Not needed for Phase 1; can be added when volume demands it |
| Dashboards & Analytics | Future phase once data is flowing through the system |
| Compliance Automation | Structured data entry handles the basics; advanced checks come later |
| Pattern Recognition | Requires order history data that Phase 1 will start generating |

### Future Phase Roadmap

Phase 1 is deliberately designed as a **foundation** that makes future phases straightforward to add:

| Phase | Focus | Builds On |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Phase 1** | Order Entry Foundation | *(this proposal)* |
| **Phase 2** | AI Validation & Insights | Order data flowing through Phase 1 |
| **Phase 3** | FX Integration & Margin Analysis | Structured order data + AI layer |
| **Phase 4** | Dashboards, Analytics & Finance Integration | Complete data platform |

## 4.2 Architecture Summary

EOMS Phase 1 uses a simple, modern web application stack:

# APPENDIX D: BENEFITS ANALYSIS

## Phase 1 Benefit Categories

Phase 1 benefits derive from **two primary sources**: time savings from structured order entry, and error reduction from database-driven data lookup.

### Primary Benefits

**1. Labour Efficiency — Time Savings**

| Metric | Current | Phase 1 Target | Saving |
|--------|---------|----------------|--------|
| Order entry time | 45 min | 15-20 min | 25-30 min per order |
| Orders per day | ~50 | ~50 | 20-25 hours saved daily |
| Annual hours saved | - | - | 5,000-6,000+ hours/year |

*Drivers: Pre-populated customer/product data, guided wizard flow, no manual product code lookup.*

**2. Error Reduction — Data Quality**

| Metric | Current | Phase 1 Target | Improvement |
|--------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| Order error rate | 5-8% | <3% | 50%+ reduction |
| Product code errors | Manual lookup | Database-driven | Near elimination |
| Missing field errors | No enforcement | Required fields | Near elimination |

*Drivers: Product database lookup (no manual entry of 7,816 codes), required field validation, consistent data structure, market eligibility display.*

### Secondary Benefits

**3. Faster Onboarding**
- New traders learn a structured system rather than mastering spreadsheet conventions
- Reduces key-person dependency and tribal knowledge risk

**4. Data Foundation (Strategic)**
- Every order stored in structured, queryable format
- Clean data enables future: AI validation, analytics dashboards, finance system integration
- Order history builds the dataset needed for pattern recognition in later phases

### Deferred Benefit Categories

| Category | Why Deferred | When Applicable |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Margin Protection | Daily PnL reporting already covers this | Phase 3 (FX integration) |
| Capacity Enablement at Scale | Requires AI automation to truly scale beyond headcount | Phase 2+ |
| Customer Retention Analytics | Requires dashboards and analytics capability | Phase 4 |

## Operating Costs

| Component | Monthly | Annual |
|-----------|--------:|-------:|
| Hosting (Vercel) | $20 | $240 |
| Database (Supabase) | $25 | $300 |
| Domain & SSL | ~$4 | $50 |
| **Total Infrastructure** | **~$50** | **~$590** |

*Infrastructure costs are operational expenses to be borne by Endeavour. No AI API costs in Phase 1.*

# APPENDIX E: RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

## Risk Register

| # | Risk | L | I | Mitigation | Owner | Status |
|---|------|:-:|:-:|------------|-------|--------|
| R1 | User adoption resistance | M | H | Simple UI focused on trader needs, involvement in UAT, phased rollout with champions | COO | Open |
| R2 | Product/customer data quality | M | M | Pre-launch data review, iterative import with validation, feedback loop with Operations | Ops | Open |
| R3 | Scope creep | M | M | Fixed Phase 1 scope with explicit deferrals, strict change control, future roadmap defined | COO | Open |
| R4 | Data extract delays | M | L | Can start development with sample data, import is iterative | Adviser | Open |
| R5 | Resource availability | M | M | Clear RACI, focused scope minimises demand on internal team | COO | Open |
| R6 | Export format uncertainty | L | L | Export format designed to be flexible (CSV/JSON), can adapt to finance system requirements | Adviser | Open |

**L = Likelihood, I = Impact (H/M/L)**

**Overall Risk Assessment: LOW** — Phase 1 uses proven technology, has a contained scope, and requires no novel integrations. The primary risk is user adoption, mitigated by involving traders in UAT and keeping the interface simple.

## Security Framework

| Control Area | Phase 1 Approach |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Authentication | Supabase Auth (email/password, SSO-ready for future) |
| Authorisation | Role-based access control (Trader, Admin) |
| Data Protection | Encryption at rest and in transit |
| Data Residency | Australian data centre (Sydney region) |
| Audit | Full audit trail of all order changes |
