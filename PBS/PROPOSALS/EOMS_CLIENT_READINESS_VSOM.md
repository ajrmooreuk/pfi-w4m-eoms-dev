# 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY — PLAIN ENGLISH

## For the General Manager / COO

**In one paragraph:** Your business currently runs $600 million of export orders through spreadsheets. Every order takes 45 minutes to process, roughly 1 in 15 has an error, and a single export container is worth $200,000–$300,000. You want to grow to $1.2 billion, but the spreadsheet system cannot keep up — you would need to double your headcount just to double your orders. EOMS is a purpose-built order management application that uses artificial intelligence to cut order processing time by 87%, reduce errors by 85%, and triple the number of orders your existing team can handle — without hiring proportionally more people.

**What it costs:** Approximately $22,000 AUD for Phase 1 (the working system), rising to roughly $70,000 over three years including enhancements and running costs.

**What it returns:** Even at a conservative 60% of the projected benefit, the system delivers $3.67 million in value over three years — a return of roughly $52 for every $1 invested. It pays for itself within the first 9 business days.

**What you need to decide:** Whether to approve the business case and release the Phase 1 investment to begin an 8–12 week build.

---

# 2. WHAT IS EOMS?

EOMS stands for **Endeavour Order Management System**. It is a modern, web-based application that replaces the current Excel spreadsheet process for managing export orders. Think of it as a purpose-built digital workspace that:

- **Guides your traders through order creation** step by step, like filling in a smart form that checks itself as you go
- **Knows your 7,816 product codes** and can search them instantly (under 0.2 seconds)
- **Checks orders automatically** — the right products for the right markets, the right currencies, the right compliance certificates
- **Shows managers a live dashboard** of where orders are in the pipeline, their value, and any items needing attention
- **Keeps a complete record** of who did what and when, for audit and compliance purposes

It runs in a web browser on any device — desktop, laptop, tablet, or phone. There is nothing to install.

### How Is It Different From a Spreadsheet?

| | Spreadsheet (Today) | EOMS (Proposed) |
|---|---|---|
| **Order creation** | Copy a template, manually type everything | Guided 4-step wizard with auto-fill and validation |
| **Product codes** | Manually look up from a separate file | Type a few letters, system finds the product instantly |
| **Error checking** | Human eye-balling, or discovered later | AI checks every field in real time before you submit |
| **Market rules** | Tribal knowledge — "ask someone who knows" | System knows which products are eligible for which countries |
| **Currency/FX** | Manual calculation, prone to errors | Automatic calculation using your bank's contract rates |
| **Approval** | Email chains, verbal sign-off | Built-in approval workflow with authority levels |
| **Reporting** | Manually count rows in Excel | Live dashboard, always up to date |
| **Audit trail** | None | Every change logged with timestamp and user |

# 3. THE BUSINESS PROBLEM IN SIMPLE TERMS

### The Situation Today

Your export team processes about 50 orders per day using Excel. Each order takes roughly 45 minutes to complete. At current volume that consumes over 12,500 person-hours per year just on order entry.

### The Three Core Risks

1. **Error risk** — With a 5–8% error rate on orders worth $200,000–$300,000 each, the annual financial exposure from errors is estimated at $850,000+. These errors lead to rework, credit notes, delays, and strained customer relationships.

2. **Growth constraint** — To reach $1.2 billion revenue, you need to process roughly 150 orders per day. The spreadsheet system cannot do this without tripling your order-entry headcount.

3. **Key-person dependency** — Critical knowledge about market rules, product eligibility, and pricing lives in people's heads. If those people are unavailable, the business is at risk.

### The Cost of Doing Nothing

If you stay on spreadsheets:
- You cannot grow to $1.2Bn without proportional headcount increases
- Error-related costs will continue at $850K+ per year
- You remain exposed to key-person risk
- Competitors using modern systems will respond faster to customers

# 4. WHAT YOU GET FOR YOUR INVESTMENT

### Investment Summary

| | Phase 1 (Working System) | 3-Year Total |
|---|---:|---:|
| **Development cost** | ~$20,000 | ~$65,000 |
| **Annual running cost** | ~$1,500/yr | ~$5,000 total |
| **Total investment** | **~$22,000** | **~$70,000** |

*Phase 1 cost in GBP: approximately £10,000*

### Return Summary (Conservative — 60% of Full Benefit)

| | Phase 1 Year | 3-Year Total |
|---|---:|---:|
| **Value delivered** | $906,900 | $3,674,100 |
| **Net benefit after costs** | $884,900 | $3,604,100 |
| **Return on investment** | **~41x** | **~52x** |
| **Payback period** | **~9 working days** | — |

### Where the Value Comes From

| Benefit | What It Means | 3-Year Value |
|---------|---------------|---:|
| **Fewer order errors** | AI catches mistakes before they cost money | $1,947,000 |
| **Faster processing** | 87% time reduction frees staff for higher-value work | $1,833,000 |
| **Growth capacity** | Handle 3x orders without proportional hiring | $500,000 |
| **Quicker staff onboarding** | New traders productive in days, not weeks | $225,000 |
| **Customer retention** | Faster, more accurate service keeps customers | $562,500 |
| **Margin protection** | AI alerts when margins are below target | $1,056,000 |
| **Full value** | | **$6,123,500** |
| **At 60% realisation** | | **$3,674,100** |

### Sensitivity — "What If We Only Get Partial Benefit?"

| If we achieve... | 3-Year Return | Still worth it? |
|---|---:|---|
| 80% of benefits | $4,898,800 | Exceptional |
| 60% of benefits | $3,674,100 | Excellent |
| 40% of benefits | $2,449,400 | Excellent |
| 20% of benefits | $1,224,700 | Strong |
| 10% of benefits | $612,350 | Good |
| **Break-even point** | **~2% of benefits** | — |

The system pays for itself even if only 2% of the projected benefits are realised.

# 5. VSOM: CLIENT SIGN-UP READINESS

## Vision

**Enable Endeavour to grow from $600M to $1.2Bn revenue by replacing manual, error-prone export order management with an intelligent, AI-assisted platform — delivered within 12 weeks at minimal cost and risk.**

## Strategy

| Strategic Pillar | What This Means for the Business |
|------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Start small, prove value fast** | Phase 1 MVP focuses on Export orders only — the highest-value, highest-pain area. Domestic and other capabilities follow once value is proven. |
| **AI does the checking, people make the decisions** | The system uses AI to validate, flag, and suggest — but every decision still requires a human to approve. No "black box" automation. |
| **Build capability, not dependency** | The system is built on your infrastructure, with your data. If the advisory relationship ends, you keep everything. |
| **Iterate based on your feedback** | The build includes formal feedback loops where your team tells us what works and what doesn't, and we adjust before go-live. |

## Objectives — What Success Looks Like

| Objective | What It Means | How We Measure It | Target |
|-----------|---------------|-------------------|--------|
| **O1: Faster orders** | Orders take minutes, not an hour | Time from start to submit | Under 15 minutes (from 45) |
| **O2: Fewer errors** | AI catches mistakes before submission | Error rate per 100 orders | Under 2% (from 5–8%) |
| **O3: Scale without hiring** | Handle growth with existing team | Orders processed per day | 150+ (from 50) |
| **O4: Compliance confidence** | System verifies market rules automatically | AI validation pass rate | Over 95% |
| **O5: Team buy-in** | Users prefer EOMS over Excel | Internal satisfaction score | Over 80% would choose EOMS |

## Measures — How We Track Progress

| Phase | What We Check | Who Checks | When |
|-------|---------------|------------|------|
| **POC Demo (Gate 1)** | Does the prototype demonstrate the concept? | COO | End of Week 2 |
| **MVP Complete (Gate 2)** | Does the system work with real data? | COO | End of Week 6 |
| **UAT Sign-off (Gate 3)** | Can real users complete real tasks? | COO + Users | End of Week 9 |
| **Go/No-Go (Gate 4)** | Are we ready for production? | GM | End of Week 12 |

**At every gate, the client decides whether to continue, adjust, or stop. No commitment beyond the current phase.**

# 6. SCOPE GAP ANALYSIS — WHAT'S MISSING BEFORE SIGN-OFF

Having reviewed all seven proposal documents in detail, the following items are **not yet defined** but would be expected by a GM/COO before approving spend. These are not flaws — they are standard items that should be agreed during the engagement process.

## 6.1 Commercial & Contractual Gaps

| # | Missing Item | Why It Matters | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **G1** | **Statement of Work (SOW) / Engagement Letter** | No formal agreement defining what is being delivered, by whom, by when, and for how much. The Proposal describes the system but is not a binding contract. | **Critical** |
| **G2** | **Payment Schedule & Milestones** | The investment is quoted as ~$22K Phase 1, but there is no payment schedule (e.g., 30% upfront, 40% at MVP, 30% at go-live). | **Critical** |
| **G3** | **Intellectual Property & Code Ownership** | Who owns the code, the data models, the ontologies, and the design system? If the advisory relationship ends, does Endeavour retain full ownership? | **Critical** |
| **G4** | **Liability & Warranty** | What happens if the system has defects after go-live? Is there a warranty period? What are the liability limits? | **High** |

## 6.2 Operational Gaps

| # | Missing Item | Why It Matters | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **G5** | **Post-Go-Live Support Model** | Who handles bugs, outages, or user issues after go-live? Is there a retainer, a support SLA, or is support billed hourly? | **High** |
| **G6** | **Training Plan** | The WBS includes "Training Plan" (WBS 6.3.1) but no actual training content, schedule, or delivery method is defined. | **High** |
| **G7** | **Change Management Strategy** | Moving from Excel to a new system requires more than training — it requires managing the human side of change (communication, champions, resistance handling). | **Medium** |
| **G8** | **Rollback / Contingency Plan** | If UAT fails or the system is not fit for purpose, what is the fallback? Can the business revert to spreadsheets while issues are resolved? | **Medium** |

## 6.3 Scope Definition Gaps

| # | Missing Item | Why It Matters | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **G9** | **Buy vs Build Analysis** | The proposal does not compare EOMS against off-the-shelf order management systems (e.g., SAP, NetSuite, TradeGlobal). A COO may ask: "Why build a custom system when we could buy one?" | **High** |
| **G10** | **Explicit Assumptions & Constraints** | No documented assumptions about data quality, user availability, internet connectivity, browser standards, or external dependencies that could delay the project. | **Medium** |
| **G11** | **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** | Running costs (~$1,500/yr) don't include staff time for training, data migration effort, ongoing data maintenance, or future enhancement costs. | **Medium** |
| **G12** | **Data Migration Scope** | The proposal mentions 7,816 product codes but doesn't define who extracts the data, who validates it, or what happens if the data is incomplete. | **Medium** |
| **G13** | **Acceptance Criteria Per Gate** | Gate criteria like "Demo successful, feedback positive" are subjective. Specific, measurable acceptance criteria would give the client confidence in what "done" looks like. | **Medium** |
| **G14** | **Scope Exclusions (Explicit)** | The MVP In-Scope/Out-of-Scope is listed but not prominent. A client-facing summary should clearly state what Phase 1 does NOT include to prevent expectation misalignment. | **Low** |

## 6.4 Governance Gaps

| # | Missing Item | Why It Matters | Priority |
|---|---|---|---|
| **G15** | **Escalation Process** | If the project stalls, who escalates and to whom? No defined escalation path for blockers, disagreements, or resource conflicts. | **Medium** |
| **G16** | **Communication Cadence** | No defined meeting/reporting schedule (e.g., weekly status report, fortnightly steering committee, monthly exec update). | **Low** |

# 7. RECOMMENDED ACTIONS BEFORE SIGN-OFF

## Must-Have Before Client Signs (Critical)

| Action | Owner | Deliverable |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Draft and agree a Statement of Work | wings4mind.ai + COO | SOW document with scope, deliverables, timeline, price |
| Define payment milestones | wings4mind.ai + CFO | Payment schedule linked to delivery gates |
| Confirm IP ownership | wings4mind.ai + Legal | IP clause in SOW (recommend: client owns all deliverables) |
| Prepare a 1-page "Buy vs Build" rationale | wings4mind.ai | Comparison showing why custom EOMS suits Endeavour better than off-the-shelf |

## Should-Have Before Development Starts (High)

| Action | Owner | Deliverable |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Define post-go-live support model | wings4mind.ai + COO | Support terms (response times, hours, cost) |
| Create training plan outline | COO + wings4mind.ai | Who is trained, when, how, for how long |
| Document assumptions & constraints | wings4mind.ai | Assumptions register (data quality, availability, etc.) |
| Sharpen gate acceptance criteria | wings4mind.ai + COO | Measurable criteria per gate (e.g., "90% of test scenarios pass") |

## Nice-to-Have Before Go-Live (Medium)

| Action | Owner | Deliverable |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| Change management plan | COO | Communication plan, champion nomination, resistance strategy |
| Rollback plan | wings4mind.ai | Documented contingency if UAT/go-live fails |
| Communication cadence | COO + wings4mind.ai | Meeting schedule, reporting template |

## What You Can Say to Your Board

> *"We are proposing a $22,000 investment to build a modern order management system for our export business. It replaces our spreadsheet process, uses AI to check orders before they go out, and enables us to handle three times the volume without proportional hiring. The system pays for itself within 9 business days, and we retain full control with gate-by-gate approval — we can stop at any point if it isn't working. Over three years, even at conservative estimates, it delivers over $3.6 million in value."*
